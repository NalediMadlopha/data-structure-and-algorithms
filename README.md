### Data Structures and Algorithms Overview
Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts of Computer Science which help in writing efficient programs in any programming language. In this repository, I will use the Python programming language to study and implement data structures and algorithms. Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Compared to other languages, I find Python easy to learn and more simpler to study and implement data structure and algorithms.

### Data Structures

Data structures in Computer Science are divided broadly into two categories shown below. 

#### Linear Data Structures

These are the data structures which store the data elements in a sequential manner.

**Array** − a sequential arrangement of data elements paired with the index of the data element.

**Linked List** − each data element contains a link to another element along with the data present in it.

**Stack** − a data structure which follows a specific order of operation. LIFO (**L**ast **I**n **F**irst **O**ut) or FILO (**F**irst **I**n **L**ast **O**ut).

**Queue** − similar to **Stack** but the order of operation is only FIFO (**F**irst **I**n **F**irst **O**ut).

**Matrix** − a two dimensional data structure in which the data element is referred by a pair of indices.

#### Non-Linear Data Structures

Non-Linear data structures have no sequential linking of data elements. Any pair or group of data elements can be linked to each other and can be accessed without a strict sequence.

**Binary Tree** − a data structure where each data element can be connected to maximum two other data elements and it starts with a root node.

**Heap** − a special case of Tree data structure where the data in the parent node is either strictly greater than/ equal to the child nodes or strictly less than it’s child nodes.

**Hash Table** − a data structure which is made of arrays associated with each other using a hash function. It retrieves values using keys rather than index from a data element.

**Graph** − an arrangement of vertices and edges where some of the nodes are connected to each other through links.
