## Data Structures and Algorithms Overview

Data structures are programmatic ways of storing data to be used (traversed, searched and modified). Algorithms
are step-by-step precedures which define a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get a desired
output. Algorithms are generally created indepent of underlying programming languages, i.e an algorithm can be
implemented in more than one programming language. Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts of 
Computer Science which help in writing efficient programs in any programming language. In this repository, I 
will use the Python programming language to study and implement data structures and algorithms. Python is a 
high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Compared to other languages, I find 
Python easy to learn and more simpler to study and implement data structure and algorithms.
